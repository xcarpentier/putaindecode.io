<code>this.setState</code> so that it can update\nthe DOM.</p>\n<p>A React class takes properties when it's instanciated: they're called <code>props</code>.\nThey shouldn't be confused with the

keeping track of the caret's position in a text\nfield that uses two-way data-binding: since the algorithm doesn't see any reason\nto update it, the text field doesn't get re-rendered and you keep the
